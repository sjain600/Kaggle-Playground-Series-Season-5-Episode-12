# Kaggle-Playground-Series-Season-5-Episode-12

## 🎯 Project Goal  
### **Diabetes Prediction Challenge**  
The primary objective of this project is to develop a classification model that predicts the probability of a patient being diagnosed with diabetes. The project was developed using data from the "Kaggle Playground Series" Season 5, Episode 12. The dataset is designed for diabetes risk prediction, analysis, and machine learning applications.

## 📦 Key Components  
- **Data Wrangling:** Cleaning, structuring, checking for missing values, assigning numerical and categorical columns 
- **Exploratory Data Analysis and Data Visualization:** Target distribution, correlation matrix, feature distribution, boxplot
- **Optuna Study:** Find the best hyperparameters for the XGBoost model
  
## Libraries and Tools Used
-   Python
-   Pandas & NumPy
-   Scikit-learn (`train_test_split`, `StratifiedKFold`, `metrics`)
-   **XGBoost**
-   Jupyter Notebook
